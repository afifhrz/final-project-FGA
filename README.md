Project 1 contains the tweets sentiment analysis model (NLP). In this project, the use of the LSTM layer is carried out.
Project 2 builds a model to predict time series. This model uses an LSTM screen with a special touch. Basically, the models in projects 1 and 2 can be said to be quite similar
In project 3, the model built is image classification for the 6 available classes. Then the model that has been built will be saved in the .tflite format for further development in the android and web environment
